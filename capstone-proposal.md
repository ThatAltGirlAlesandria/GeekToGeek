## Name of Student: _Alesandria Wild_

## Name of Project: Geek to Geek

## Project's Purpose or Goal: A dating side for "nerdy" and "geeky" people.

### List of absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Allow users to create and store a profile.
* Create a compatibility quiz for users to match them.
* Create a messaging feature for users to message each other.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* I decided that I would be using Golang (Go), JavaScript, and Vue.js for the languages. If I need to add additional later on I may consider it. I however, doubt that I will.

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* I would like to find a way to include a block button for users.
* A way to black users with the same IPaddress from creating a new account if banned.


### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* WIP

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
