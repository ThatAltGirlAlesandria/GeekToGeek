                <li>Personal Summary: I am a well known actress and producer. I grew up in Australia. At the age of 8 my mother placed me in Circus school where I was given a certificate for the trapeze. I have worked as many as three jobs at a time to get where I am today. I value hard work and dedication. I am the BIGGEST Potter Head. I chose to spend my birthdays reading Harry Potter. I went so far as to lie about needing glasses as a kid just so I could look more like Harry Potter.</li>
