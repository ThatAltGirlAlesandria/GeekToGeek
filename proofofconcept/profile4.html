    <p>Personal Summary: I was a child actor best known for playing Hermione Granger in Harry Potter. Growing up in the film industry lead me to a life of activism after seeing and experiencing the difficulties of acting at a young age. One of my colleagues was an alcoholic before he was 15. I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. While attending Brown University I was able to receive a Bachelors in English Literature. This has allowed me to properly convey the changes we need in order to progress as a society. I am a strong activist for child actors, gender equality, and women's rights. I have been privileged enough to be allowed to speak to the UN about gender inequality. While I did co-star in the Harry Potter series I do not condone JK Rowling's revolting statements.</p>
